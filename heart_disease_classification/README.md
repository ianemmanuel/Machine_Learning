This repository consists of two logistic regression machine learning models that use binary classification to classify whether or not a data set was obtained from a person with heart disease. The first model uses all the variables apart from ‘income’ and ‘education’ to classify data. The second model uses high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and smoking to classify data. The second  model used the three variables because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and smoking as three key risk factors for heart disease. The data set used to train and test these models is attached.
